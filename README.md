Wunderlist wasn't cutting it

TO USE:

1. fork it, clone it down
2. add your students in a .json file if they are not already there *(pending feature to just pass it an xml file or something)*
3. host the json locally with json-server (install instructions [found here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#getting-started) here if you do not already have json-server)
    - use the terminal command `json-server --watch YOURCOHORT.json`
4. spin up the project in a browser window with yarn
    - use the terminal command `yarn install` followed by the command `yarn start`
5. *Don't* use the reset button....yet
